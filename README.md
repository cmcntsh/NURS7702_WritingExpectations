# NURS7702 Writing Expectations

## General Tips

### Role of the Scholarly Project Chair:

* Facilitate your learning through all phases of the project: planning, development, implementation, and evaluation.
* Provide guidance and feedback on your work, including your scholarly manuscript.
* Help ensure you meet all project requirements, including QI/IRB compliance.
* Maintain consistent and effective communication with you.

### Tips for Success in Your Scholarly Project:

Based on the DNP Scholarly Project Handbook and general best practices, here are a few tips to help you succeed:

* **Proactive Communication:** Maintain open and timely communication with me regarding your progress, any challenges you encounter, or if you anticipate missing a deadline. It is your responsibility to contact me in advance if situations arise that impact assignments or due dates.
* **Utilize Course Resources:** Take full advantage of the resources provided in the Canvas course, including announcements, podcasts/videos, examples, and guidelines like the SQUIRE Guidelines Table and manuscript template.
* **Plan Ahead:** The DNP project has distinct phases and requires careful planning. Begin thinking about your project ideas, potential clinical questions, and establishing relationships with organizations and potential sponsors early on.
* **Embrace Scholarly Writing:** Scholarly writing is a key component of this project and your professional development. Be prepared for an iterative writing process and utilize resources like Grammarly Premium and the Graduate Writing Center.
* **Attend Meetings Prepared:** Come to our bi-weekly meetings prepared to discuss your progress, ask questions, and engage in a productive discussion.

### Here are some key points to remember while you're writing and before submitting assignments:

* Download and install the Grammarly add-in.
* Address the issues in your writing that Grammarly identifies. (Assignments that have multiple spelling or grammar errors or that have problems with clarity and conciseness will be sent back to you for correction before grading.)
* **Assess how well you have addressed the content for each section with AI before submitting your assignments. If you have missed certain content, address it before submitting your assignment. (If you haven't been using ChatGPT or another chat tool, we can go over how to use this when we meet.)**

Last semester, I provided you with a  short list of readings to reinforce some principles of effective scholarly writing. https://github.com/cmcntsh/NURS7701_WritingExpectations They're all short, just a couple of pages. They're split out week by week. They talk about the kinds of things I look for in scholarly writing. My hope is to get us all on the same page when it comes to writing your papers next semester. I attended a writing workshop held by George Gopen at the University of Utah in 2023. While these articles are addressed to a legal audience, the same principles apply to scholarly writing in the sciences.

## AI Prompts for Evaluating Writing in General (Use these on all paper sections.)

#### Analyze How Paragraphs in a Section Connect With Each Other

I recommend doing this with each paper section separately.

Prompt:

```
You are an expert editor of academic writing and scholarly articles. We are going to analyze this text according to the reader expectation approach to writing described by George Gopen. We are going to focus on the logic and flow between the paragraphs of a piece of writing. Gopen states that a backward link to the previous paragraph is easiest for the reader to make if it connects to the same two locations: (1) the beginning of the previous paragraph, where its issue is stated; or (2) the end of the previous paragraph - the nearest neighbor to this new paragraph. Backward connections to the middle of the previous paragraph are harder for the reader to perceive. For each paragraph, write out the paragraph. Then answer these questions about each paragraph. Does the paragraph have a single main issue? What is it? Does the paragraph have good logic and flow internally? Does the paragraph connect well with the previous paragraph? If there is a connection between the paragraph and the previous paragraph, does the paragraph connect with the beginning, middle, or end of the previous paragraph? Are the paragraphs arranged in a logical sequence? Do the paragraphs have good flow from one to the next?
Here is the text: "<paste text here>"
```

#### Analyze a Paragraph and Each Sentence in the Paragraph Using Concepts from  George Gopen's Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

```
You are an expert editor of academic writing and scholarly articles. We are going to analyze this text according to the reader expectation approach to writing described by George Gopen. Gopen states that a paragraph should describe the issue of the paragraph in the first one to three sentences of the paragraph. Gopen also states that if the paragraph explicitly states a point, it should be stated as the last sentence of the issue or the last sentence of the discussion of the paragraph. For each paragraph, write out the paragraph. Then answer these questions about each paragraph.
What is the issue of the paragraph? What is the paragraph about? Does the paragraph have a one-sentence, two-sentence, or three-sentence issue? What are the discussion points in the paragraph? Is the ordering of discussion points logical? What is the point of the paragraph? Why was the paragraph written? Is the point of the paragraph explicitly stated, or is it implied? Is the paragraph a narrative paragraph that simply relays information so a point can be made later, or is the point of the paragraph explicitly stated in the paragraph? Does the point appear at the beginning of the paragraph or at the end? If the paragraph explicitly states a point, does the point appear at the last sentence of the issue or at the last sentence of the discussion, or somewhere else in the paragraph? Does the paragraph have a coda as the last sentence of the paragraph? Can you suggest any improvements to how the paragraph is structured? Is the ordering of the paragraphs logical? Can you suggest any improvements to how the paragraphs should be ordered?
Next, analyze each sentence according to the concepts for sentence construction in the reader expectation approach described by Gopen. List each sentence and answer the following questions for the sentence.
Which words in the sentence appear in the stress position just before a period, a colon, or a semicolon? What nominalizations are used in the sentence? What are the main actions expressed as verbs in the sentence? What is the main clause of the sentence? Does the main clause end with a period, colon, or semicolon? What is the grammatical subject of the main clause? Is there a qualifying clause or phrase in the sentence? What is the subject of the qualifying clause or phrase? Does the sentence have two main clauses separated by a comma? Is the subject and the verb separated by more than four words in the sentence? Does the sentence connect backward to the sentence that precedes it? If so, what is the connection? How close to the beginning of the sentence does the link to the previous sentence appear? Can you suggest any improvements to how the sentence is structured? Can you suggest any improvements to how the sentence links to the preceding sentence to improve flow?
Here is the text: "<Paste paragraph text here between quotes.>"
```

#### Evaluate Which Sentences Need Supporting Citations and References

```
Since this is academic writing, which sentences have assertions that should be supported with a citation to a reference? Please list each sentence that needs a citation and why it needs one.
```

#### References

Prompt: Check the formatting of references in the references list. (These need to be double-checked to verify correctness, but this prompt caught many formatting problems.)

```
Do these references follow proper APA 7 formatting guidelines? Please suggest specific improvements where needed. Here are the references: "[paste references here in quotes]"
```

Prompt: Match citations used in the body of the paper to references in the reference list. Identify citations missing a reference and references missing a citation.

```
Here is a piece of text and a reference list that is supposed to be formatted to APA 7 standards. Please list each sentence in the text that includes a parenthetical or in-text citation and the reference in the reference list that matches each citation. After listing the sentences that use citations, please list each reference in the reference list that is not cited in the text. Here is the text: "<paste text here>" Here is the reference list: "<paste reference list here>"
```

Prompt: Evaluate the problem description section of a quality improvement paper. (See 3. Problem Description at https://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID=471&nodeID=1)

This section should cover most of the aspects described in the section instructions unless there are elements that are not relevant to this particular problem or information that is simply not available at this point. I would assess the comprehensiveness of the student's writing and identify any gaps left unaddressed by the student, and assign a grade according to the point rubric accordingly.

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? Why are you doing this project? What is the problem youâ€™re addressing? Is the problem is clinical, process-based, safety-related, educational, or organizational? What data quantify the size and seriousness of the problem (incidence, prevalence, baseline rates, local data, or benchmarking data)? Who is affected (patients, caregivers, providers, other stakeholders or parts of the healthcare system)? When is it a problem? Are any trends over time identified? Why does it matter (patient safety, quality of care, health equity, other considerations)? Why does it matter now (national priority, local mandate, tied to organizational goals, accreditation standards)? How does it affect the patient or system (outcomes, safety, satisfaction, quality of life, workflow, burnout, errors, efficiency, costs, reputation, compliance with standards)? Has a cause been identified locally? Are any contextual factors related to the problem identified (staffing, applications like EHR or others, policies, communication issues, other)? What will happen if this problem is not addressed (continued harm, inefficiency, cost increases, staff burnout, regulatory issues, other)?
