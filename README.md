# NURS7702 Writing Expectations

### Role of the Scholarly Project Chair:

* Facilitate your learning through all phases of the project: planning, development, implementation, and evaluation.
* Provide guidance and feedback on your work, including your scholarly manuscript.
* Help ensure you meet all project requirements, including QI/IRB compliance.
* Maintain consistent and effective communication with you.

### Tips for Success in Your Scholarly Project:

Based on the DNP Scholarly Project Handbook and general best practices, here are a few tips to help you succeed:

* **Proactive Communication:** Maintain open and timely communication with me regarding your progress, any challenges you encounter, or if you anticipate missing a deadline. It is your responsibility to contact me in advance if situations arise that impact assignments or due dates.
* **Utilize Course Resources:** Take full advantage of the resources provided in the Canvas course, including announcements, podcasts/videos, examples, and guidelines like the SQUIRE Guidelines Table and manuscript template.
* **Plan Ahead:** The DNP project has distinct phases and requires careful planning. Begin thinking about your project ideas, potential clinical questions, and establishing relationships with organizations and potential sponsors early on.
* **Embrace Scholarly Writing:** Scholarly writing is a key component of this project and your professional development. Be prepared for an iterative writing process and utilize resources like Grammarly Premium and the Graduate Writing Center.
* **Attend Meetings Prepared:** Come to our bi-weekly meetings prepared to discuss your progress, ask questions, and engage in a productive discussion.

### Here are some key points to remember while you're writing and before submitting assignments:

* Download and install the Grammarly add-in.
* Address the issues in your writing that Grammarly identifies. (Assignments that have multiple spelling or grammar errors or that have problems with clarity and conciseness will be sent back to you for correction before grading.)
* **Assess how well you have addressed the content for each section with AI before submitting your assignments. If you have missed certain content, address it before submitting your assignment. (If you haven't been using ChatGPT or another chat tool, we can go over how to use this when we meet.)**

Last semester, I provided you with a  short list of readings to reinforce some principles of effective scholarly writing. https://github.com/cmcntsh/NURS7701_WritingExpectations They're all short, just a couple of pages. They're split out week by week. They talk about the kinds of things I look for in scholarly writing. My hope is to get us all on the same page when it comes to writing your papers next semester. I attended a writing workshop held by George Gopen at the University of Utah in 2023. While these articles are addressed to a legal audience, the same principles apply to scholarly writing in the sciences.

Run the prompts on your paper and address gaps before submitting for grading.

### Title

Prompt: Evaluate the title of a quality improvement paper (See 1. Title at https://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID=471&nodeID=1)

```
How well does this title meet the following criteria: Does the title indicate that it is about an initiative to improve safety, value, and/or quality in healthcare? Does the title describe the aim of the project? Does the title describe the context in which the project occurred? Is the title descriptive? Is the title simply written? Which terms in the title allow the reader to identify easily that the project is within the field of healthcare improvement? Which medical subject headings (MeSH) in the National Library of Medicine’s Medline database apply to this title? Please suggest ways the title could be improved and provide a revised title. Here is the title: "<paste the title here inside quotes>"
```

### Problem Description

Prompt: Evaluate the problem description section of a quality improvement paper. (See 3. Problem Description at https://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID=471&nodeID=1)

This section should cover most of the aspects described in the section instructions unless there are elements that are not relevant to this particular problem or information that is simply not available at this point. I would assess the comprehensiveness of the student's writing and identify any gaps left unaddressed by the student, and assign a grade according to the point rubric accordingly.

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? Why are you doing this project? What is the problem you’re addressing? Who is affected? When is it a problem? Why does it matter? How does it affect the patient or system? Has a cause been identified? What will happen if this problem is not addressed?

### Available Knowledge

Prompt: Evaluate the Available Knowledge section of a quality improvement paper. (See 4. Available Knowledge at https://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID=471&nodeID=1)

This section should cover most of the aspects described in the section instructions unless there are elements that are not relevant to this particular problem or information that is simply not available at this point. I would assess the comprehensiveness of the student's writing and identify any gaps left unaddressed by the student, and assign a grade according to the point rubric accordingly.

```
What evidence is cited in the following text to answer each of these questions? What is currently known about the problem in general, including relevant previous studies? Who is affected by the problem? What are the impacts of the problem? How does the problem affect those individuals? When is it a problem? Why is it a problem or why does the problem matter? What are the costs or the other negative impacts of the problem? How prevalent is the problem or how many people are affected? Are there any existing trends that contribute to the problem? Are probable causes of the problem identified? Are there any formal standards related to this problem? How are the main concepts relevant to the problem defined? Is any supporting literature or evidence cited?

### Rationale

Prompt: Evaluate the Rationale section of a quality improvement paper. (See 5. Rationale at https://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewPage&pageID=471&nodeID=1)

```
How well does the following text discuss each of these elements? What frameworks, models, concepts, or theories are used to explain the problem? What frameworks, models, concepts, or theories were used to develop the intervention? What reasons or assumptions were used to develop the intervention? Why is the intervention expected to work? Describe the framework, model, or theory used to guide the activities of your project? Describe how the framework, model, or theory aligns with and guides the work on the project?
